</p><h1>Error establishing a database connection</h1>
<p>This either means that the username and password information in your <code>config.php</code> file is incorrect or we can't contact the database server at <code>localhost</code>. This could mean your host's database server is down.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you sure you have the correct username and password?</li>
	<li>Are you sure that you have typed the correct hostname?</li>
	<li>Are you sure that the database server is running?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're unsure what these terms mean you should probably contact your host. If you still need help you can always visit the <a href="http://reos.elazos.com/">ReOS Support Site</a>.</p>
